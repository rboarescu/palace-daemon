# Changelog

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`purge_wings.py`** — offline SQLite-based wing purge utility; bypasses ChromaDB entirely to safely bulk-delete drawers when HNSW is stale or corrupt. Deletes in 500-item batches, backs up before changes, clears HNSW segment dirs so daemon rebuilds a clean index on next start.

### Changed
- `palace-daemon.service` hardened with two `ExecStartPre` guards: `fuser -k 8085/tcp` clears any stale process holding the port; `rm -f /tmp/palace-daemon-8085.lock` removes a stale lock file. Both prefixed with `-` so they're no-ops when nothing is blocking.
- README systemd section updated: system service is now the recommended install for always-on hosts; user service demoted to desktops/dev only. Added `WARNING` callout against installing both (causes crash-loop collision on port 8085).
- Bumped `VERSION` to `1.4.1`.

### Fixed
- Removed 10,828 rogue drawers mined from `~/.` and `~/palace-daemon/` by the old `mempalace hook run` fallback. Palace reduced from 11,632 → 685 real drawers. Vector index rebuilt via `mempalace repair`.
- Resolved dual user+system service collision that caused crash-loop on `systemctl restart palace-daemon`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`clients/hook.py`** — stdlib-only hook runner replacing `mempalace hook run`. Routes all mine operations through `POST /mine` on palace-daemon; never spawns mempalace as a subprocess. If daemon is unreachable, passes through silently with no fallback to direct DB access.
- **`clients/bootstrap.sh`** — one-command client setup script. Copies `mempalace-mcp.py` and `hook.py` from Artemis and wires them into Claude Code, Gemini CLI, VSCode, Cursor, or JetBrains. Clients need no mempalace install — both files are stdlib-only.
- **`docs/hook-routing-fix.md`** — permanent plan document capturing the hook routing fix design, constraints, and verification steps.

### Changed
- `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.gemini/settings.json` hook commands updated to use `hook.py` instead of `mempalace hook run`.
- `~/.mempalace/hook_settings.json` `daemon_url` normalised to `http://localhost:8085` (was `192.168.0.42:8085`) on Artemis.
- `README.md` — expanded Clients section: remote client table, `hook.py` usage and behaviour, `hook_settings.json` field reference, per-tool hook configs, `bootstrap.sh` usage.

### Security
- Mine operations now require explicit user approval via block response before executing; no implicit auto-mine on session stop.
- `MEMPAL_DIR` is the only mine trigger; transcript directory fallback removed.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Auto-Healing HNSW Index** — daemon now automatically detects "Internal error: Error finding id", quarantines stale index segments via `quarantine_stale_hnsw`, and retries the request seamlessly.
- **Silent Save / Flush** — implemented automatic memory checkpointing on daemon shutdown via `lifespan` and added a manual `POST /flush` endpoint.
- **Port-Specific Locking** — lock files are now dynamic (`/tmp/palace-daemon-{port}.lock`), allowing parallel instances (e.g., production and shadow/test palace) on the same host.
- **Chaos Test Suite** — added `chaos_test.py` for high-concurrency validation and index corruption simulation.

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` with "Shadow Palace" testing workflow and new API endpoints.
- Improved logging for auto-repair events to provide better visibility during recovery.
- Bumped internal version to 1.3.0.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Daemon Instance Locking** — implemented fcntl-based file lock (`/tmp/palace-daemon.lock`) to prevent multiple daemon instances from running concurrently
- **Graceful Shutdown** — added SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers to ensure clean exits and reduce risk of stale SQLite locks during restarts
- **Hardened Service** — `palace-daemon.service` now enforces explicit environment paths (`MEMPALACE_PALACE`) to prevent path ambiguity

### Changed
- **"Daemon-Only" Policy** — removed the direct fallback mode in `mempalace-mcp.py`. The client now exits with an error if the daemon is unreachable. This prevents "split-brain" scenarios and potential database corruption from concurrent process access.
- Improved HNSW stale index detection to catch more internal error variations and provide specific recovery commands.

### Security & Stability
- Added high-visibility warnings against accessing the database over network mounts (NFS/Samba) which caused `SQLITE_IOERR` in previous versions.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- `POST /backup` endpoint — performs atomic, verified SQLite backups with integrity checks
- `POST /reload` endpoint — clears internal client cache to refresh the database index
- Self-healing hints — the daemon now detects "Internal error: Error finding id" during searches and provides actionable advice

### Fixed
- `palace-daemon.service` — port conflict handling: added `ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/fuser -k 8085/tcp` to ensure port 8085 is free before starting
- Improved service reliability by adding `KillMode=mixed` to `palace-daemon.service`
- `main.py` — added `VERSION` constant and exposed it in `/health`

### Changed
- Updated documentation with API references for new endpoints and clearer systemd instructions

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- `clients/mempalace-mcp.py` — SyntaxError on startup: `--api-key` argument
  used `default=API_KEY` before `global API_KEY` declaration; changed default
  to `None` so the client actually starts

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- `PALACE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` env var (default 4) — tunes read concurrency at runtime
- `clients/mempalace-mcp.py` fallback mode — if the daemon is unreachable at
  startup, falls back to importing `mempalace.mcp_server` in-process instead
  of exiting, so Claude Code keeps working when the daemon is down

### Changed
- Replaced `asyncio.Lock()` with three semaphores for concurrent access control:
  - `_read_sem(N)` — up to N concurrent read-only ops (search, query, stats, …)
  - `_write_sem(N//2)` — up to N//2 concurrent write ops (add, kg mutations, …)
  - `_mine_sem(1)` — one mine job at a time, independent of reads/writes
- `/mine` now uses `_mine_sem` only — long import jobs no longer block read or
  write traffic (requires mempalace ≥3.3.2 for internal mine locking)
- `/health` bypasses all semaphores — always responds immediately even under
  full load, safe for load balancers and monitoring
- `/stats` fans out its three sub-calls with `asyncio.gather()` — response time
  cut to roughly one third of the previous sequential implementation

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `POST /mcp` — full MCP JSON-RPC proxy endpoint
- `GET /health` — daemon + palace status
- `GET /search` — semantic search over palace drawers
- `GET /context` — alias for /search, named for LLM tool prompts
- `POST /memory` — store a drawer (wing, room, content)
- `GET /stats` — wing/room counts, KG stats
- `POST /mine` — run `mempalace mine` under the global asyncio.Lock,
  serializing bulk imports against live queries
- Optional API key auth via `PALACE_API_KEY` env var (`X-Api-Key` header)
- Configurable host, port, palace path via CLI args or env vars
- `clients/mempalace-mcp.py` — zero-dependency stdio MCP proxy for remote clients
- systemd service unit (`palace-daemon.service`)
